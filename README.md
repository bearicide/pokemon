README – Matt’s Pokémon Collection Sale

Overview

This repository contains a complete breakdown of my available Pokémon card collection, including:

Raw near-mint singles

Graded PSA, CGC, and SGC slabs

Estimated market values based on realistic recent SOLD listings

A full HTML page that formats all listings cleanly


This is not a hype page, not a “listed at $2,000” clown show.
If you’re here, you’re probably interested in buying the whole box or negotiating for specific cards.
