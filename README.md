Pokémon Sale Page — Gold Metal Charizard

This repository hosts a minimal, intentionally simple sale page advertising a single card:

2021 Pokémon Celebrations Ultra Premium Collection
Gold Metal Charizard — SGC 9 (Mint)

Everything else from my personal collection is not publicly listed at the moment.

What this page is

A live listing for one confirmed, available card

A contact funnel for serious buyers

A way to avoid stale prices, sold cards, or outdated inventory

If you see this page, the Gold Charizard exists and is available unless otherwise stated.

What this page is not

A full binder

A price guide

A promise that other cards are available without emailing

Inventory outside of the Gold Charizard changes frequently and is handled privately by email.
